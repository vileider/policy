Device microphone activity

This app does not use analytics, ads, or any user-tracking mechanisms.

3. Third-Party Libraries
Some third-party libraries may request permissions automatically (e.g., expo-av, expo-camera). These are used only for media functionality within the app â€” not for surveillance or data collection.
